"""Find what the collector would miss, without the network or Docker. Three checks:

* a tracked file that downloads or installs something but is not read by the collector;
* a file the collector reads for some commands (a Makefile for `pip install`, a workflow for `uses:`)
  that also holds a command it does not read;
* a build file (the Dockerfile and its scripts) in which a download, `git clone` or install command
  did not become a dependency, or that uses `wget`, which the readers do not support.

All fail loudly so that a new script, or a command in a new shape, is noticed when it is added,
not when a list turns out to be incomplete. Python 3.8 compatible."""
