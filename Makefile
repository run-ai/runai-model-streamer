# Filesystem read strategies, every one we support. Each list keeps sync_buffered last as the

# Run the suites that actually respond to RUNAI_STREAMER_FS_STRATEGY, once per strategy.
#
# Replaces the old `test_iouring` target, which swept only three strategies, never covered
# libaio_direct, and was manual because we believed CI had no io_uring. CI does have it - measured.
#
# Only three suites are swept, because only these three change behaviour with the strategy:
#
#   cpp test_strategy    the two C++ targets that inherit the environment. The rest pin their own
#                        strategy with utils::temp::Env or drive MockIoEngine.
#   test-unit-real       the Python tests against the REAL library. `make -C py test` runs them
#                        against the mock, which stubs the C API and reaches no reader at all.
#   tests fuzzing        the only local-filesystem integration test. tests/s3, tests/gcs and
#                        tests/azure read object storage, which the filesystem strategy never reaches.
#
# Measured at roughly 27s + 21s + 10s for all four strategies together.
