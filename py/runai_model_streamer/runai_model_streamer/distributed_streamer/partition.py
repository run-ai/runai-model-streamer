    tensor.

    Cuts the stream into n parts with the smallest largest part.

    Binary search on the answer. For a candidate ceiling, walk left to right and cut whenever the next
    tensor would not fit; the ceiling is feasible when that needs at most n parts. The smallest
    feasible ceiling is the best possible, because every rank waits for the slowest and the tensors
    cannot be split.

    The search starts at max(largest tensor, total // n) because no partition can beat either bound:
    one tensor has to live somewhere whole, and the work has to go somewhere.

    The search asks the same question about 38 times - once per halving of the byte range - so how a
    single probe is answered decides whether this is free or slow.

    A probe must not step through the tensors one at a time. The prefix sums are what avoid it: each
    rank's cut becomes one binary search over the running totals, so a probe touches about as many
    entries as there are ranks, rather than all 150,000 tensors of a large model.

    Measured on 90,000 tensors: 19 ms this way, 705 ms stepping through them - about 1.2 s on a model
