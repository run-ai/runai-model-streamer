    responses from runai_response. Credentials are streamer-scoped (runai_set_credentials), not passed
    here. Many submissions may be in flight at once.

    A submission is a list of files, each carrying a list of RANGES. A range is an arbitrary
    (source offset, size) within its file with its own destination: ranges need not be contiguous in the
    file, need not be contiguous in memory, and need not be ordered. Exactly one response is issued per
    range, including a zero-sized one.

    paths carries one entry per file, however many ranges that file has. The three range arrays are flat,
    indexed identically, and grouped by file in the order of paths: file f's ranges occupy
    [sum(num_ranges[:f]), sum(num_ranges[:f+1])). Destinations must not overlap - that is the caller's
    responsibility and is not verified.

    range_dsts holds ABSOLUTE integer addresses - one complete pointer per range, not offsets from a
    base, and in no required order. Deliberately not memoryviews:
      - a destination need not be host memory at all. A CUDA device pointer has no Python buffer object,
        so a base-buffer + offsets signature would silently restrict destinations to the host.
      - destinations need not share a buffer, which is the same generality the range API exists for.
      - it avoids one memoryview -> address conversion per range on the submit path (~n per submission).
    The cost is that raw addresses keep nothing alive: THE CALLER MUST KEEP THE UNDERLYING BUFFERS ALIVE
    for the lifetime of the submission, until its last response has been consumed."""
