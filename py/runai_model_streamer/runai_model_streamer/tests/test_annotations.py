    """Every annotation in the package must actually resolve.

    These modules use `from __future__ import annotations`, which stores annotations as STRINGS and never
    evaluates them. That hides two classes of bug from the test suite and from import itself:

      - a type used in an annotation but never imported (`Tuple` without `from typing import Tuple`);
      - syntax the target interpreter cannot evaluate, e.g. PEP 604 `str | None` on Python 3.8.

    Neither shows up when the code runs. They surface only when something resolves the annotations - a type
    checker, `typing.get_type_hints`, a docs generator, pydantic - or the moment someone deletes the
    `from __future__ import annotations` line, at which point the module fails at IMPORT.

    Both bugs were present in this package and invisible until a reviewer read them. This test resolves
    every annotation so the next one fails here instead.

        silent-degradation the test exists to prevent. Every module in the package imports cleanly today,
