# congruent and direct reads would quietly become buffered ones.
#
# Not per path. Alignment belongs to the mount, and different mounts are served by different engines -
# but congruence at a power of two implies congruence at every smaller one, so this one value covers
# every mount a request touches. The library treats it as a ceiling it stays under.
#
# Resolved at import, like the library handle it comes from (libstreamer/__init__.py opens the .so at
# module scope). It must not change under a running streamer: the ring is laid out against it once.
# The layout block, resolved PER REQUEST from the mounts the paths actually live on - see
# direct_block_for() in the library. This module-level value is only the fallback used when no
# streamer handle is available to ask with, and equals the host page size.

#
# The pool base is moved to a multiple of this, and then advised with MADV_HUGEPAGE, so the whole
# pool sits on 2 MiB pages instead of 4 KiB ones.
#
# The reason is O_DIRECT, not the copying. Every direct read pins its destination pages before the
# DMA - about 2,048 pages per 8 MiB read, and at 10 GiB/s that is roughly 2.6M pins per second, on
# the one async worker thread. On 2 MiB pages the same read pins 4. Buffered reads pay none of this,
# so it is a cost that O_DIRECT adds rather than one it removes.
#
# Doing it here rather than leaving it to the allocator, because the allocator is not ours. glibc may
# already align a large allocation to a huge page and advise it - measured on one host, a plain
# np.empty comes back with the `hg` flag set and fully huge-page backed - but that depends on the
# glibc version and a tunable, neither of which we control on a customer's node.
#
# A 2 MiB base is also a multiple of DIRECT_IO_BLOCK, so it replaces the old 4096 shift rather than
# adding to it.
#
# OFF unless RUNAI_STREAMER_HUGE_PAGES=1. See _huge_pages_enabled() for the measurements on both
# sides and for why the default is off despite the gain.
#
# THIS SIZE IS FOR THE POOL BASE ONLY. Padding between ranges stays at DIRECT_IO_BLOCK, and must: if
# congruence had to hold modulo 2 MiB, one pad could cost 2 MiB and the 1024-pad budget would want
# 2 GB per buffer instead of 4 MB.
#
# It does not, because the two sizes answer different questions. O_DIRECT alignment comes from the
# STORAGE DEVICE - its logical block, 512 or 4096. A huge page is a property of the MEMORY MAPPING.
# The kernel does not tie them together. Measured on a huge-page-backed pool: a direct read into an
# address one block into a huge page succeeds, as does three blocks in, as does the last block; only a
# non-block-aligned address fails, with EINVAL.
#
# And it costs nothing to sit inside a huge page rather than at its start - io_submit for 64 reads of
# 2 MiB took 1.14-1.42 ms with destinations one block in, against 1.27-1.45 ms with them 2 MiB
# aligned. Pinning still walks one compound page either way.

    """Whether to place the pool on huge pages. OFF by default - opt in with RUNAI_STREAMER_HUGE_PAGES=1.

    Off by default despite a large measured gain, because the risk is on a machine we have not tested
    and the gain is on one we have.

    MEASURED GAIN. Time inside io_submit for 64 direct reads of 2 MiB, on an unfragmented host:

        first pass   50 ms plain   ->  27 ms advised
        every pass   8-10 ms       ->  1.0-1.6 ms

    The second row is the one that counts. Faulting happens once, because the ring is reused for the
    whole stream, but PINNING happens on every direct read - O_DIRECT pins each destination page
    before the DMA. At 4 KiB that is 512 pages per 2 MiB read; at 2 MiB it is one. So this is a 7-8x
    cut in io_submit time on every pass, and io_submit runs on the single async worker, where blocking
    also stops completions being reaped.

    THE RISK, and why the default is still off. With the node's THP defrag set to `madvise` - which is
    common, and is what this host uses - advising a region opts it into DIRECT COMPACTION at fault
    time. On a node whose memory is fragmented the kernel may compact before it can hand out a huge
    page, and that wait lands inside the same io_submit. compact_stall in /proc/vmstat stayed at zero
    throughout our runs, so the bad case is unmeasured rather than absent.

    The two are asymmetric: compaction can only slow the FIRST touch of the pool, while the pinning
    gain applies to every read after it. That is an argument for turning this on once a fragmented
    node has been measured, not for turning it on blind.

    hugetlbfs would remove the risk entirely - pre-reserved pages are never compacted or swapped - but
    it needs node pre-allocation and a pod hugepages-2Mi request, which is a cluster decision rather
    than a code one (design_async_io.md 5.10).

    Anything other than "1" leaves it off, so a typo is safe rather than surprising."""
