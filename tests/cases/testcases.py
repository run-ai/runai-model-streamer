            Kill the streamer (context-manager __exit__ -> runai_end) while object-storage
            reads are still in flight, without draining all tensors, and assert the process
            does not crash (no core dump). This exercises the persistent-responder teardown
            (stop() with outstanding responses) plus the S3 client lifecycle.

            Each teardown runs in a fresh subprocess: an in-process segfault/abort during
            runai_end would kill the test runner itself, so isolation is what makes a crash
            observable -- as a negative return code (killed by a signal, i.e. the condition
            that drops a core). A crash and a clean error are reported distinctly. Core dumps
            are enabled in the child so a crash also drops a core we detect on disk as a
            supplementary signal (skipped when the kernel pipes cores elsewhere).

            An unlimited memory limit dispatches the whole file in a single wave, so all
            chunks are outstanding in the capacity queue / object-storage client at once.
            Several fresh processes randomize the teardown moment to cover both "after a
            response was consumed" and "before any response arrived". After each kill the
            child creates a NEW streamer in the SAME process and streams the whole file,
            checking every tensor's data against the reference -- so a killed streamer must
            not invalidate the next one that reuses the process-global object-storage client.
            Distinct per-tensor payloads make that data check catch wrong offsets and
            cross-tensor swaps. A final fresh-process stream then confirms the backend is
            healthy across process boundaries too.
