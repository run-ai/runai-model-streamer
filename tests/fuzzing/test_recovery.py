    """A per-range error must not break the streamer for everything after it.

    Runs against the REAL library on purpose. The mock cannot express this: it serves every range
    synchronously from the calling thread, so a range is never genuinely in flight when the error fires
    and the streamer always appears to recover.

    Nothing here is filesystem specific. The drain lives in FileStreamer.get_chunks, above the
    backend, so an object-storage submission fails and recovers through the very same code - the filesystem
    is used only because it needs no emulator. Object storage differs in severity, not behaviour: its reads
    are genuinely in flight when the error fires, so more ranges are still writing into a buffer the next
    stream_files is about to free.
