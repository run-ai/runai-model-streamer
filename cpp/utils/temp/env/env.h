{

// Sets an environment variable for the lifetime of the object and restores its previous value (or
// leaves it unset) on destruction.
//
// It OVERWRITES a variable that is already set. An earlier version did not, and a test whose variable
// was already in the environment then ran under a value it did not choose. setenv reports success
// when it declines to overwrite, so nothing failed and nothing was logged - the test simply checked
// something else. That is reachable whenever a variable is exported in the shell or passed with
// bazel's --test_env.
//
// THE CONTRACT: on one variable, these must be destroyed in STACK ORDER, on one thread.
//
// Nesting is fine, and is used deliberately. This pair appears in several tests:
//
//     utils::temp::UnsetEnv unset(SomeVar);      // clear whatever the environment had
//     utils::temp::Env      env(SomeVar, "2.0"); // then set exactly what this test wants
//
// It works because each object saves the state it finds: Env sees "unset", so ~Env unsets, and
// ~UnsetEnv then puts the original back. That is what makes a test independent of a variable
// exported in the shell or passed with bazel's --test_env.
//
// What breaks it is destruction OUT of stack order, which needs a heap-allocated instance or a second
// thread. Then the first destructor restores the value it saved while the other object is still
// active, and the second restores something stale or unsets a variable it never set. The variable
// ends up holding whatever the later destructor happened to see - silently, in a helper whose entire
// job is to leave the environment as it found it.
//
// NOT enforced, and neither half of the obvious enforcement works:
//
//   a mutex   would be worse than nothing. setenv and getenv are not thread-safe - setenv may
//             reallocate `environ` while another thread is inside getenv, which is the race
//             PRE_SETENV_DELAY papers over in the .cc. Locking our own writers leaves every reader
//             thread exposed while making the helper look safe across threads, which it is not.
//
//   a check   can only run in the destructor, since nesting is legal and only the ORDER is wrong.
//             ASSERT throws (logging.cc), and throwing from a destructor during unwinding calls
//             std::terminate; LOG(ERROR) would be silent, because no log sink is enabled under bazel.
//
// So: single-threaded, stack-scoped. Do not put one of these on the heap.
