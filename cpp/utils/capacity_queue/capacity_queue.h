// CapacityQueue - a credit-bounded pending queue.
//
// Holds items that are waiting to be submitted and bounds how much "work" may be
// in flight at once. The owner submits items by calling try_take() (which reserves
// the item's cost against the capacity) and releases credit by calling complete()
// when an item finishes, which lets the next pending item become takeable.
//
// cost and capacity are in caller-defined units: bytes for the S3 in-flight window
// (bandwidth-delay product), or an operation count for threadpool-bounded backends.
//
// NOT THREAD SAFE - by design. It is meant to be owned by a single worker that
// enqueues, takes and completes on one thread; the cross-thread completion signal
// (e.g. an async callback) is delivered through a separate thread-safe queue, and
// the worker calls complete() from its own loop. Keeping this object single-owner
// makes it a deterministic, independently testable unit.
