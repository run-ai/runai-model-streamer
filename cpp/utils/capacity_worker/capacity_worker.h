// CapacityWorker - a Worker (see threadpool.h) for asynchronous backends. It owns a CapacityQueue (the
// in-flight window) and implements execute/drain/idle as the submit+drain interleave pattern, so a
// concrete worker only fills the backend hooks (see the protected section). `Chunk` is the unit submitted
// to the backend and held in the window.
//
//  * execute submits a request into the window, draining internally to make room until the request is
//    fully submitted, then drains once more to free a slot - so it returns ready for the next request and
//    can never stall on a full window.
//  * drain progresses the tail one batch at a time (so a newly arrived request can interleave - the pool's
//    worker_routine re-checks the queue between drains).
//  * idle is true once nothing is pending or in flight (and while the window hasn't been created yet).
//
// The window is created lazily via the capacity() hook, which receives the request and returns the window
// size. If capacity() (or the queue allocation) throws - e.g. an empty request, or the backend client cannot
// be built - the base catches it, hands the request to discard() so the worker can finalize it, and retries
// on the next request; the queue is not created until a request can size it, so nothing is chunked before the
// window exists. The pattern lives here once; concrete workers implement capacity/discard/enqueue/submit/
// drain_batch. Backends that don't need a window (filesystem) don't derive from this at all - they use
// ThreadPool's stateless Handler constructor.
