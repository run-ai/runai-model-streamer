    // ends a whole model load because one file could not be read.

    // The synchronous reader already decided this, and for the same reason - see the comment in
    // file.cc. Both readers must agree, because which one served a request is meant to be invisible
    // to the caller.

    // errnos used to sit in this place; it could not be complete, and EISDIR was one it missed.
