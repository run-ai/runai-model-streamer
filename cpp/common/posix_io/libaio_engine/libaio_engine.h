// How long this engine spent inside io_submit.
//
// libaio's io_submit can block. It waits on filesystem metadata, on extent lookup, on faulting the
// destination buffer, or on a busy block layer. io_uring has no equivalent: its submit is a ring
// append. One worker does both submitting and reaping, so a blocked submit also stops reaping, and
// the number of reads in flight falls while we wait.
//
// The design accepts that instead of using RWF_NOWAIT (5.8.1). These numbers are how we check that
// choice. If they stay small, nothing more is needed. If one call takes milliseconds, the answer is a
// submit thread, and these are the evidence for it.
//
// How to read them:
//
//   nanos / iocbs   the normal cost of submitting one read
//   max_nanos       the worst single call
//   iocbs / calls   the average batch size, which says whether stage-then-flush is buying anything
//
// The total alone would mix two different things. io_submit always costs something, and that cost
// grows with the number of reads in the call. A stall looks different: one call far longer than the
// per-read cost. That is why the worst call is kept separately.
//
// What the blocked time costs in throughput depends on the device. If the device is saturated at our
// depth, a short block costs little, because the reads already in flight keep it busy. If it is not
// saturated, every read that finishes without being replaced lowers throughput at once, so the
// blocked time is close to the loss. Network filesystems are usually not saturated, and libaio is the
// engine that runs there.
//
// The number that separates those two cases is the achieved depth, and nothing records it yet - plan
// S8b adds it. Until then, read the blocked time as an upper bound on what was lost.

};

// IoEngine over libaio.
//
// The fallback engine. io_uring is faster, but container runtimes block io_uring_setup in their
// default seccomp profile, and hardened platforms turn it off. libaio is not in that blocked set -
// measured, io_setup returns 0 both with and without seccomp. So this is the engine that runs on
// hosts where io_uring cannot (design 5.7).
//
// Direct reads only. libaio is asynchronous only with O_DIRECT. A buffered read inside io_submit runs
// inline, so one thread would serve one file at a time, and the path it would replace is a 16-thread
// pool of preads with kernel readahead. The Strategy enum has no LibaioBuffered value, so there is
// nothing for this class to reject at runtime.
//
// NOT THREAD SAFE, like the interface. One worker owns it and makes every call.
//
// Deliberately absent:
//
//   RWF_NOWAIT       it is unreliable on NFS and virtiofs, where a filesystem that does not
//                    implement it falls back to blocking without saying so - and those are the
//                    mounts where the blocking actually lasts. It also does not make io_submit
//                    non-blocking; faulting pages, ring-lock contention and allocation under memory
//                    pressure all survive it. Its EAGAIN would also break the no-deadlock argument in
//                    5.9, because it means "this read would have blocked", which reaping does not
//                    relieve. See SubmitStats for what is measured instead.
//
//   io_cancel        measured: it returns EINVAL for a direct read, and the read then completes
//                    normally anyway. So there is nothing to cancel, and the drain is required
//                    whatever we do. Teardown is quiesce-then-report in the worker, which needs
//                    nothing from the engine - see io_engine.h.
//
//   registered memory   libaio has no equivalent. The base class no-ops cover it.
