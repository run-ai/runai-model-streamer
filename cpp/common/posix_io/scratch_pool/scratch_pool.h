// Aligned buffers for reading the partial blocks at the edges of a region.
//
// A direct read needs its offset, its length and its address to be block multiples. A region rarely
// starts or ends on a block boundary, so its first and last blocks are read into one of these and the
// wanted bytes are copied out. Everything between is read straight into the caller's memory.
//
// ONE BLOCK per buffer, not one chunk. That is the whole reason this is cheap. An earlier design gave
// every in-flight slot a chunk-sized buffer, which is depth x 8 MiB - about 2 GiB at depth 256 - and
// then had to limit how many reads could bounce at once. A block-sized buffer makes the pool
// depth x 4096, a few megabytes, so there can be one per in-flight read and no limit at all.
//
// NOT THREAD SAFE. One worker owns it, like everything else on this path.
