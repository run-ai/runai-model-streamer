//                    synchronous reader is not modified by the async work, and it has no shared
//                    submission point to wedge, so there is nothing to isolate by splitting it.
//   FileSystemAsync  ONE POOL PER MOUNT. Each pool has one thread, which owns an AsyncIoWorker and
//                    its IoEngine. One thread per pool, because the engine is not thread safe (5.2).
//                    A separate pool per mount, not one pool with several workers: all workers in a
//                    pool take work from the same queue, so one pool could not keep a mount's work
//                    on one engine.
//   ObjectStorage    `s3_concurrency` threads, each worker owning a plugin client and its own
//                    in-flight window.
//
// Object storage is served by a single plugin (the backend handle is a process-wide static), so the one
// ObjectStorage pool serves one plugin. That small lock lives here too (an optional + leaf mutex).
//
// Keep this object in the streamer member slot the single ThreadPool used to occupy, so object-storage
// workers still join between S3Stop and S3Cleanup on teardown.
