// Assigns submission ids and tracks, per submission, how many responses remain to be consumed,
// so the single consumer can decide when a submission is complete (submission_done) and report
// its throughput. One submission == one runai_request(_ex) call.
//
// Self-contained and thread-safe: its mutex is a STRICT LEAF - it is never held while touching
// the responder or the thread pool (and this class never calls into them), so it cannot be
// nested with those locks in either order. That keeps the streamer's lock ordering trivially
// consistent. The clock is injectable so throughput is deterministically testable.
