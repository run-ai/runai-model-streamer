// CONSTRUCT ON THE FIRST WORKLOAD, never at streamer construction. Depth is divided by
// RUNAI_STREAMER_PROCESS_GROUP_SIZE, which the Python layer does not write until stream_files() -
// long after runai_start() has returned. Building this early reads the unset default of 1, skips the
// division, and says nothing: the device then sees eight times the intended depth at TP=8.
//
// Every value is clamped against its real ceiling here and logged when clamped. A configured number
// that quietly never materialises is worse than one that is rejected.
