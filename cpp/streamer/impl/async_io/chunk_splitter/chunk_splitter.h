// This does NOT re-apply the boundary rule. Batches::handle_request already cuts tasks so that none
// crosses a multiple of chunk_bytesize, so the chunks are simply the tasks grouped by which chunk
// they fall in. Deriving them instead of computing them again is what stops the two from drifting
// apart - and if they did drift, a chunk would cover part of a task and its completion would report
// bytes that had not arrived.
//
// Chunks cover the NON-EMPTY tasks. Every task with bytes belongs to exactly one chunk, and reading
// that chunk is what accounts it.
//
// Zero-sized tasks - which a zero-sized range produces - are NOT covered. They read nothing, so no
// completion will ever arrive for them, and the caller must complete them AT ENQUEUE. That rule is
// unconditional: a zero-sized range owes a response like any other, and waiting for I/O that is never
// issued strands the caller's buffers forever. Object storage already does exactly this.
//
// Spans stay contiguous for simplicity, so a zero-sized task sitting between two non-empty ones falls
// inside a span. Accounting it a second time is harmless - Task::finished_request is idempotent behind
// its _finished guard - but a worker should skip zero-sized tasks when accounting a span rather than
// rely on that.
//
// A batch with no bytes at all therefore yields NO chunks, and all of its tasks are completed at
// enqueue.
//
// Takes std::vector<Task> rather than the Tasks alias, which lives in batch.h - the splitter has no
// business pulling in Batch, the responder and the object-storage wrapper just to name a vector.
