// Which filesystem strategy this streamer uses: one answer, for the streamer's whole life.
//
// The strategy names an ENGINE, and the engine is streamer-scoped (5.7), so this is settled once and
// never revisited. What varies per file is the cache mode and the mount - a different question,
// answered elsewhere.
//
// Resolution walks the candidate list and takes the first the host can provide, logging each
// rejection with its reason. Exhausting the list is an error carrying those reasons, never a silent
// fall-through to the synchronous reader: an operator who asked for io_uring and quietly got
// something else has no way to find out.
//
// Availability comes from the PROBES - IoUringProbe and LibaioProbe - and never from building an
// engine. An engine needs a depth, which needs RUNAI_STREAMER_PROCESS_GROUP_SIZE, and it belongs to
// the worker; a probe needs nothing.
//
// Thread safe - several submitters can race on the first request.

    // Replaceable for testing, because otherwise the interesting cases cannot be reached. Every
    // strategy is available on a normal host now - sync_buffered always, libaio nearly always, and
    // io_uring wherever seccomp permits it - so there is no candidate a test can use to exercise a
    // rejected head or an exhausted list.
    //
    // Those tests used `libaio_direct` for that, which worked only while libaio had no engine. When
    // it got one they broke, which is the good outcome: a test that depends on a feature being
    // MISSING should fail the day it arrives.

    // is what the probes' own tests take care to avoid.

    //     Success, a different value is rejected. Silently replacing a value the caller already acted
    //     on is worse than refusing.
    //
    //   - After resolution, any value differing from the one actually resolved from is rejected -
    //     INCLUDING the first. Without this, a caller who set nothing, let the first request resolve
    //     from the environment, and only then called this would pass the first-set-wins test and get
    //     Success with no effect at all. A setter that reports success and changes nothing is the
    //     failure this rule exists to prevent.
    //
    // So a caller who wants a different strategy needs a new streamer. That is the answer credentials
    // give, for the same reason: something has already been built from the first answer.
