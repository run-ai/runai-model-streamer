// The one number that matters for a direct read.
//
// The kernel has separate limits for the memory address and for the file offset, and they can differ.
// The fully general rule is harder than it is worth. We use the larger of the two for everything, so
// one number covers all three checks. Over-aligning is always correct. It only wastes a little.
size_t block_size(const Limits & limits);

// The block size we assume a direct read needs, and the default for direct_block_size() below.
//
// 65536, assumed rather than measured. statx reports the real numbers through STATX_DIOALIGN, which
// arrived in kernel 6.1 while our floor is 5.15 - and it is missing from the build headers here even
// on a 6.8 kernel.
//
// Raised from 4096. That covered every block size in use at the time (512 and 4096) and nothing more.
// 16K-logical-block NVMe is arriving, and on such a device an O_DIRECT open SUCCEEDS and every read
// then fails with EINVAL - so the assumption fails on exactly the storage a fast loader is bought for.
// 64 KB covers 512, 4K, 16K, 32K and 64K at once.
//
// Over-aligning cannot fail, and here it is close to free. The streamer places its own destination
// buffers (see the note on is_congruent below), so congruence is arranged rather than hoped for, and
// the cost is bounded by the head and tail blocks of each chunk - under 2% of an 8 MB chunk at this
// size. See design_measured_alignment.md.
//
// Read by two places that must agree:
//
//   the engines   IoUringEngine and LibaioEngine both report it as their Limits alignment
//   routing       streamer.cc file_groups decides congruence before any engine exists, so it cannot
//                 ask an engine and needs the number early
//
// They share the constant rather than each writing 4096, because a disagreement would be invisible.
// Routing and the worker would differ about which files can be read directly, nothing would fail, and
// the reads would quietly take a path nobody intended.
//
// If an engine ever measures the real value with statx, it will report something equal or NARROWER
// than this, and routing stays correct: it would refuse a few files that could have been read
// directly, sending them to the synchronous reader. Slower for those files, never wrong.
constexpr size_t DirectBlockSize = 65536;

// The block actually used, which is DirectBlockSize unless RUNAI_STREAMER_DIRECT_BLOCK overrides it.
//
// A knob rather than a constant for two reasons. It lets a benchmark compare block sizes without a
// rebuild, and it lets an operator drop back if a mount turns out to prefer a smaller one.
//
// Read ONCE and cached: it is consulted per read, and an environment lookup on that path would be
// visible. It also must not change under a running streamer - routing decided congruence against one
// value and the worker must plan passes against the same one.
//
// Rejected values fall back to DirectBlockSize with a warning rather than failing: a mistyped block
// should not stop a model loading, and every rejected value would break posix_memalign in ScratchPool
// or the congruence maths.
//
// PYTHON READS THE SAME VARIABLE (requests_iterator.py, DIRECT_IO_BLOCK). The two must agree: Python
// pads the ring to make destinations congruent, and if it padded to a different block than this one
// tests against, congruence would fail and direct reads would quietly stop happening.

// the process, so a test cannot reach these rules through the environment.

//
// An OVERRIDE, not a default: when set it replaces the per-mount measurement entirely. That is what
// makes it an escape hatch - a way to pin the block when a measurement is wrong or when comparing
// values - and it is how the benchmark holds one arm at 4096 while another measures.
//
// Distinct from direct_block_size(), which answers "what do we use when nothing was measured" and so
// cannot tell an explicit 65536 from the default.
size_t direct_block_override();

// Can ANY part of this read be done directly?
//
// This is the rule that decides everything, and it is not "is the address aligned". A direct read
// puts file byte F+k at address B+k: the two move together. So it needs one k where both
// (F+k) and (B+k) are multiples of the block. That is possible only when:
//
//     (B - F) % block == 0
//
// If it fails, there is no such k anywhere in the range - not at the start, not in the middle. The
// range has no aligned part at all, so 100% of it must be copied. If it holds, only the first and
// last blocks need care.
//
// For an address and a file offset chosen without thought, this holds about once in `block` tries.
// That is why the streamer places its own buffers on purpose - see o_direct_alignment.md section 7.
bool is_congruent(size_t file_offset, const void * buffer, size_t block);

// A direct read that covers [offset, offset + bytesize), with everything aligned.
//
// The start moves DOWN to the block below, and the length moves UP. So the read covers more of the
// file than was asked for. The extra bytes are real file data, and they have to go somewhere:
//
//     head bytes  land at   buffer - head
//     tail bytes  land after the wanted data
//
// THE CALLER MUST OWN THAT SPACE. This function only does arithmetic. It cannot know whether there is
// room before `buffer`, and writing there is what an overrun looks like. The streamer's own pool
// reserves that space on purpose; memory from a caller does not have it, which is why a read into
// caller memory does not take this path.
//
// Only meaningful when is_congruent() holds. Without congruence there is no aligned read that lands
// the wanted bytes in the right place, whatever the rounding.

// a log tells nobody anything. This names each rule and says which one broke:
//
//   direct read rejected: offset=8000 (align 512 BAD), buffer=0x... (align 512 ok),
//                         length=100 (align 512 BAD), congruent=no
