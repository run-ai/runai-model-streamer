// Whether libaio can be used on this host.
//
// Simpler than the io_uring question, and asked for the same reason. io_uring is refused by container
// seccomp profiles and by kernel.io_uring_disabled, so it must be probed rather than version-checked.
// libaio is not in Docker's blocked set - measured, io_setup returns 0 both with and without the
// default seccomp profile - so it is almost always available.
//
// "Almost" is the reason this exists. io_setup draws on /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr, which is node wide
// and shared with every other pod. A node that has exhausted it refuses io_setup with EAGAIN, and
// then libaio is unavailable however healthy the kernel is.
struct LibaioCapability
{
    // A context was created and destroyed here.
    //
    // NOT a promise that a context of the CONFIGURED depth will succeed - the probe asks for one
    // event. The engine halves and retries from the configured depth, so it will normally get
    // something; if even that fails, mark_unavailable() takes libaio out of the chain.
    bool available = false;

    // Why not, when !available. EAGAIN means the node's aio limit is reached, which an operator can
    // raise; anything else means this kernel does not provide aio at all.

// Create a one-event context, then destroy it.

// Stateless and uncached, so a test exercises the probe rather than a memo of it. Two syscalls.

// The answer, probed once and then remembered.
//
// Cached because it is read on two paths - strategy resolution and every make_io_engine() - and under
// one engine per mount the second runs once per mount. What the host provides cannot change while we
// run, so one probe answers all of them.
//
// A class rather than a free function with a static, so a test can own an instance and exercise
// caching and demotion without leaving process-wide state for the next test. Same shape as
// IoUringProbe on purpose: two probes that answer the same kind of question should not need to be
// read in two different ways.
//
// Thread safe.

    // will fit. When that fails, retrying is pointless - the node's aio budget does not grow on its
    // own - and worse than pointless during resolution, which would keep choosing a strategy it
    // cannot build.
