// check that choice. If they stay small, nothing more is needed. If one call takes milliseconds, the
// answer is a submit thread, and these are the evidence for it.
//
// How to read them:
//
//   nanos / requests   the normal cost of submitting one read
//   max_nanos          the worst single call
//   requests / calls   the average batch size, which says whether stage-then-flush is buying anything
//
// The total alone would mix two different things. Submission always costs something, and that cost
// grows with the number of reads in the call. A stall looks different: one call far longer than the
// per-read cost. That is why the worst call is kept separately.
//
// REPORTED BY BOTH ENGINES, on purpose. libaio's io_submit is known to block - it waits on filesystem
// metadata, on extent lookup, on faulting the destination, or on a busy block layer. io_uring's
// submit is described as a ring append, which should make it far cheaper. That is a claim about the
// kernel, and measuring only the engine we already distrust cannot check it: without the same
// counters on both, a batch size tuned on libaio evidence would be applied to io_uring on faith.
