// 3000. Only 8 and above, at a power of two, are accepted.
//
// This used to be `block == 0 ? 1 : block`, and 1 is the one value that cannot allocate. block_size()
// hands out 1 as its "no rule to follow" fallback (alignment.cc), so the fallback meant to keep
// things working was exactly the input that made this constructor throw UnknownError - blaming the
// allocation, when nothing was wrong with the request.
//
// Unreachable today: the pool is built only for a direct strategy (async_io_worker.cc), and both
// direct engines report DirectBlockSize. But the fallback exists for the case where an engine
// reports no rule, so it must not be the value that fails.
//
// Rounded UP, never down. _block is also the SIZE of each buffer, not only its alignment, and a
// bounced pass needs a whole block - so a short buffer would be a worse bug than a misaligned one.
